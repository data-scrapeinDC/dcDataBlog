I recently pulled all of the data on Wikipedia about Federally elected officials being arrested. I had assumed (wrongly) that if a Republican or Democrat was in office, they would push for investigations and convictions of the "other side", so to speak.

Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find that both sides actively went after their own. About the same percentage, 50% more R or D's, were convicted while a likewise President was in the executive offie. The rand of crimes these men and women created varied - from taking bribes (coincidentally the number 1 crime) to one poor man being tried and prosecuted for being gay.

Here is the link to the data sheet. I originally put this up on Google Sheets so I could show others exactly how easy it was to scrape data from a given site and do a little data cleanup and/or magic to create a decent looking story. Feel free to download the sheets or add them to your Google Drive so you can play with the data. Here are some highlights:

Democrats convicted their own over the last 120 years about 54.5% more than Republicans.

Republicans convicted their own over the 120 years at 50% more often.

Several Democrats were arrested for Child Pornography or for sexual misconduct with a minor.

With the exception of a few Presidents, most convicted 3 or 4 Federal officials while in office (4 year terms).

Nixon, Reagan, and Clinton represented nearly 50% of the convicted members.

If Trump and his cabinet members are guilty of Russian Collusion, that would be the first conviction of Treason ever for a Federally elected official.

But seriously, don't take my word for it. I do this for fun, so maybe check my work and see what conclusions you can draw from the data I'm providing. I hope you enjoyed playing with the data. I hope to make these more interactive in the future. Data is always better when you can see changes to investigate findings.
